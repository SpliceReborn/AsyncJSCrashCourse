## Task description 

Write a program that does the following tasks: 
1. Place order (2 seconds)
2. Cut the fruit (2 seconds)
3. Add water and ice (1 second)
4. Start the machine (1 second)
5. Select container (2 seconds)
6. Select toppings (3 seconds)
7. Serve ice cream (2 seconds)

These tasks will be solved using various methods, including callbacks, promises, async/await. We illustrate that repeated use of callbacks result in a callback hell and how other methods allow the code to be more readable and maintanable.
